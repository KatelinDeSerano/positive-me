PositiveMe

https://lit-shelf-99422.herokuapp.com/

Summary:
PositiveMe is a fullstack javascript application that aids users in finding silver-linings in their day to day happenings by guided journaling. This app supports basic CRUD operations - users should be able to: 

  * Create a new Journal Entry
  * View previous Journal Entries
  * Edit Journal Entries
  * Delete Journal Entries
  
  
  Inspiration: 
  One of the simplest and most helpful pieces of advice I have ever gotten from a teacher is the the power of "yet".  By adding this little, three letter word at the end of any negative, self-sabatoging thought,  I instantly feel like I can (eventually) conquer anything!  For example - "I can't do this" turns into "I can't do this...yet".  This practice is an example of positive thinking.  I know a lot of self-critical people, including myself, that struggle with practicing positive thinking.  Before it becomes a habit,  it requires daily practice, like journaling.  I wanted to provide an app for guided journaling,  specifically for thinking in more positive ways.
